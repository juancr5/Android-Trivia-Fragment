Codelab de Android Trivia Fragment

**Solution code**
=====================================

This app is the solution code for Android Kotlin Fundamentals codelab 3.1:
Create and add a fragment. The app is also the starter code for Android Kotlin
Fundamentals codelab 3.2: Define navigation paths.

**Introduction**
------------

The AndroidTrivia app asks the user trivia questions about Android development.
It makes use of the navigation component within Jetpack to move the user between
screens. Each screen is implemented as a fragment.

The app navigates using buttons, the app bar, and a navigation drawer. Because
students haven't yet learned about saving data or the Android lifecycle, the app
tries to eliminate bugs caused by configuration changes.
